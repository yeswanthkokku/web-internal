<p>The YSR Congress has submitted a notice for a no-trust motion against the Modi government
Andhra Pradesh CM and TDP boss N Chandrababu Naidu have announced they will support the no-trust motion.
The YSR Congress alone - with its tally of nine MPs - would be well short of the 50 nods required for the motion.</p>
<p>NEW DELHI/VIJAYWADA: The YSR Congress submitted a notice for a no-confidence motion against the Modi government for its refusal to grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh, the first such move in the tenure of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, setting the stage for engrossing politics on Friday morning in the Lok Sabha.</p>
<p>Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party boss N Chandrababu Naidu immediately announced support for the motion and YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy is understood to have sought the backing of other opposition parties.</p>
<p>His tally of nine MPs is well short of the 50 required for the motion to be admitted and even TDPâ€™s 16 MPs will not be enough for the purpose.</p>
<p>Political sources, however, did not rule out the possibility of non-NDA parties <q>fishing in troubled waters</q> and using the opportunity to set up a debate which, despite the localised issue listed, may allow a wider attack on the Modi government.</p>
<p>The YSR Congress move also seems intended to outgun TDP on the state issue with Naidu having withdrawn his ministers from the Centre.</p>
<p><q>We are ready to support the no-confidence motion against the Union government moved by any party if it means discussing many pending issues in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2016,</q> Naidu announced in the assembly on Thursday.</p>
